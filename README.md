Android game - 24 points

The original version of 24 is played with an ordinary deck of playing cards with all the face cards removed.

The aces are taken to have the value 1 and the basic game proceeds by having 4 cards dealt and 
the first player that can achieve the number 24 exactly using only allowed operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) wins the hand. 
Some advanced players allow exponentiation, roots, logarithms, and other operations.
